AI developer course by Ecom school

Each lecture will be in new brunch with name of the lecture's date.

In the lecture we learnt:
1) The usage of git: only create repo, commit, drag &drop files.
2) type str-intro, type float -decimal number, function type().
3) how to get number type from input():
```
     year_birth:int=int(input("enter your birth year:\n"))
```
4) concat string:
   can't concat string to number
```
   "p"+"ython"
    "python_"*3
```

**known writing rules**:

## must: 

  
  
  no spaces in parameters, no capital letters in the beginning of the word. can be with "_"  between (my_address) or with capital letter to separate words (myAddress)

## recommended:

declearing type of the parameter: x:int (means parameter is from int type)- only for the reader, it **doesn't** define the type of the parameter.

;- in 1 line to separate between 2 commands:

    x:int=777;y:int=8888
    
  at the end of command:
  
    x:int=7777;
